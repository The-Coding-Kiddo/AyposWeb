Error Handling Consistency: Some error handling is just console.error without user feedback or recovery.
Security: No mention of authentication, authorization, or input validation. If this is a production system, these are critical.
Scalability: State is mostly local; for larger apps, consider a state management library (Redux, Zustand, etc.) or React Context for shared/global state.
Code Comments: Some complex logic could benefit from more inline comments for maintainability.
Modularity: Some files (e.g., pages) are quite large and could be split into smaller, focused components.
Environment Variables: API URLs are hardcoded in some places; best practice is to use environment variables for all endpoints.
Accessibility: No explicit mention of accessibility (a11y) practices (e.g., ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).
